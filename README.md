#  Medical Imaging Fusion using Wavelet Transform

This project focuses on **fusing multimodal brain MRI images** (T1ce, T2, FLAIR) 
from the **BraTS2020 dataset** using wavelet-based methods (Haar & Daubechies).  
The main goal is to enhance diagnostic quality by combining complementary features from different modalities.

##  Features
- Preprocessing of brain MRI scans
- Image fusion using Haar and Daubechies wavelets
- Evaluation with quantitative metrics:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
  - Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
